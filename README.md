Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This specific project was for a banking app to help teach investment and banking. It is meant ti track funds and intrest earned so that it could be easily calculated. 

What did you do particularly well?

I felt that I was able to complete this project particularly wall becasue the assignment was faily clear and the directions were the most clear on what the project needed to have. It is also a project that did not rely on prviously written code so I did not have to build on something else that had already been written. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

To enchance this code I would make the menu look a bit better and I would add a few other options for the user to know to quit at any time during the process. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I did not find this code particularly challanging. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I will be able to use a lot of the foudational skills that I learned with this code and the practice on splitting the code into different modules helps a lot too with up;coming coding classes. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Since this is split into different header files, it makes it easier to manipulate.
